# droneOnCatnip

Just an example of flying the AR Drone 2 with Catnip

Instructions on installing catnip
https://github.com/bodil/catnip
## Usage

Drone module is loaded by lein.
Just do lein deps or something.
To start captnip: lein edit

The functions don't work, cause I hardly know Clojure and I justed tested to seee if this works and score hipster points on stage by taking off and landing the drone with Captnip.
